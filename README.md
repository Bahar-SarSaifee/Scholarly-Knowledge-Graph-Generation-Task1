# Scholarly-Knowledge-Graph-Generation-Task1

### Task #1 - Extracting Research Themes

For this task, teams will be asked to develop a model that can identify and label research papers with a research theme. There will be a total of 36 themes, each paper will be labelled with a single theme.

Competitors will be provided with 2 files, train.csv and test.csv. The train.csv file will contain the details for each paper in question and the class label (the research theme). The test.csv file should then be used for evaluating your trained models.

Task participants are required to:

- Develop methods addressing the task and submit the results via Kaggle
- Document and submit their method as a short paper as specified on the SDP 2022 website
- Provide source code for each method
